# load-canary-home.ps1
#   Arm the OFFSITE (ATS) apply canary AND start HOME apply workers at LOW concurrency.
#
#   The home box is memory-tight (it also runs Postgres, the brain, ibgateway, etc.) and an
#   OOM hang is what killed worker home-0. So this loader deliberately keeps the worker count
#   small and auto-sizes it from FREE RAM. For the heavy lifting, run load-canary-remote.ps1
#   on the second box -- the canary you arm here is fleet-wide (shared Postgres fleet_config),
#   so the remote workers consume the SAME canary; you only arm it once, here.
#
#   RUN THIS IN YOUR OWN POWERSHELL on the home box (real environment) -- not through Claude --
#   so the worker windows open on your desktop and the Claude/Codex agent creds resolve.
#
#   Examples:
#     .\load-canary-home.ps1                       # arm canary=3, 1 home Claude worker, $25 cap
#     .\load-canary-home.ps1 -Canary 5 -Count 2    # bigger first run, 2 workers (only if RAM allows)
#     .\load-canary-home.ps1 -SkipQueuePrep        # queue already populated: just arm+approve+run
#     .\load-canary-home.ps1 -WithWatchdog         # also launch the self-healing watchdog
#
