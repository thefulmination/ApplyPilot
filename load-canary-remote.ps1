# load-canary-remote.ps1
#   Start REMOTE (second-box) apply workers at HIGH concurrency -- the workhorse of the fleet.
#
#   The canary is armed ONCE on the HOME box (load-canary-home.ps1) and lives in the shared
#   Postgres fleet_config. This box does NOT arm anything and NEVER touches the SQLite brain --
#   it only LEASES approved jobs from the home Postgres, applies them, and heartbeats back.
#   Because the canary + spend-cap in fleet_config bound the WHOLE fleet, you can run as many
#   workers here as the box's RAM allows without changing the blast radius.
#
#   Prereqs (one-time, via setup-fleet-worker.ps1 from machine2-bundle.zip):
#     * same LAN as the home box; home Postgres reachable (pg_hba 192.168.1.0/24, firewall :5432)
#     * .venv with `pip install -e .`, Playwright Chromium installed, codex/claude logged in
#     * pgpass.conf has the home Postgres password
#
#   RUN THIS IN YOUR OWN POWERSHELL on the remote box.
#
#   Examples:
#     .\load-canary-remote.ps1                       # auto-size workers from this box's RAM
#     .\load-canary-remote.ps1 -Count 8              # force 8 workers
#     .\load-canary-remote.ps1 -HomeIp 192.168.1.187 -Label m2 -Agent codex
