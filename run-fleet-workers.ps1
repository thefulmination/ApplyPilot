# run-fleet-workers.ps1 -Count N [-Agent claude|codex] [-Label home] [-Model name] [-StartSlot 0]
#   Spin up N apply workers in TRUE parallel: each gets a DISTINCT slot (0..N-1), so each runs
#   its OWN isolated Chrome profile + CDP port + log -- N jobs applied at once, no shared-browser
#   collision. (Multiple workers on the SAME slot is the "3-4 tabs fighting over one Chrome" bug;
#   this launcher avoids it by construction.)
#
#   It first STOPS any running apply workers (a clean slate so stale same-slot processes can't
#   keep colliding), then opens one window per worker.
#
#   Examples:
#     .\run-fleet-workers.ps1 -Count 3                      # 3 Claude workers on the home box
#     .\run-fleet-workers.ps1 -Count 4 -Agent codex -Label m2                 # slots 0..3
#     .\run-fleet-workers.ps1 -Count 4 -Agent claude -Label m4 -StartSlot 4    # slots 4..7
#
#   Cost note: each home-box (claude) worker is ~$0.65-0.90/apply, so N workers = N x spend RATE
#   (the canary + cost cap still bound the TOTAL). Codex workers ride your ChatGPT Pro plan.
#   LinkedIn NEVER runs here -- that lane is one-IP, one-worker, by hand.
