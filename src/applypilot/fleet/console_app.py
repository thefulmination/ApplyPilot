"""applypilot-fleet-console: a LOCAL, LAN-ONLY web control panel for the apply fleet.

This replaces hand-run SQL with a tiny, audited HTTP surface that is safe enough to
operate a system that submits REAL job applications under the owner's name.

DESIGN / SAFETY (the review rubric S1-S6 lives here):
  * stdlib ONLY -- http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer + json + argparse. NO new pip deps.
    The HTML/CSS/JS frontend is embedded as a string below.
  * Every consequential mutation goes through a STRICT ALLOW-LIST (a dict), never
    eval/getattr on the request action string, and never SQL built from request input.
  * Reuses the proven, tested fleet functions (pgqueue / apply_home_main / codex_bridge)
    rather than reinventing their queries. Connections are short-lived (one per request)
    and always closed in a finally.
  * NO LinkedIn WRITE controls anywhere -- LinkedIn is the catastrophe lane and is shown
    strictly read-only. There is no arm/resume/apply action for it.
  * LAN-ONLY bind: the server refuses to bind 0.0.0.0 or any public IP. It binds a private
    IPv4 (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16) or 127.0.0.1 only.
  * No secrets are written to disk or logged; the DSN is never printed.

WORKER LIVENESS SOURCE (per the task's explicit instruction):
  The apply workers DO write worker_heartbeat. WorkerLoop._beat -> worker.py:_heartbeat
  UPSERTs worker_heartbeat with last_beat=now() on EVERY tick (idle, applying, etc.), and
  apply_worker_main builds a WorkerLoop(role='apply'). So liveness here is REAL, derived
  from worker_heartbeat.last_beat: alive = last_beat within 150s. We filter to role='apply'
  (the LinkedIn lane is excluded from the controllable view) and join current_job (a url)
  back to apply_queue for the company/title of the job a worker is on.
